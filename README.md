# Text_Shuffle
A small just-for-fun Java program that shuffles strings a specified number of times, outputs all the shuffles, all matching shuffles in alphabetical order, and the most frequently occurring shuffle

Also includes a graphical version which scales matching shuffles by frequency and visually displays them

To run on command line, make sure you have the latest jre and javac version installed. From the directory you downloaded Shuffle.class to, type 'java Shuffle'. To compile after changing Shuffle.java, type 'javac Shuffle.java' from the directory Shuffle.Java is in

Future goals: runtime optimization
